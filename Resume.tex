\section*{Research and Project Experience}
\resumeItem
{Senior design team: Polymorphic logic}
{Aug--Dec 2019}
{Investigated the design and integration of experimental ambipolar transistors using CMOS as a proxy. Personally specified, documented, and implemented the digital control modules for custom logic cells. Integrated the team project into the larger SoCET system on a chip for fabrication at MIT Lincoln Labs.}

\resumeItem
{MIPS dual-core processor}
{Sep--Dec 2019}
{Designed, implemented, tested, and synthesized a MIPS-based processor featuring a five stage pipeline, and two cores with independent coherent L1 caches. Used SystemVerilog to implement RTL logic and testbench scripts for design validation. Synthesized design to target an Altera Cyclone FPGA.}

\resumeItem
{Tetris hand-held game console}
{Mar--May 2019}
{Developed an STM32-based handheld Tetris console as a member of a four-person team. Personally created an SPI driver for the embedded display using C\texttt{++} and assembly.}

\resumeItem
{ASIC module for USB to AHB bridge}
{Nov 2018}
{Collaborated to design and test a USB to AHB bridge suitable for use on an SoC. Personally designed and wrote SystemVerilog code for the USB receiving/decoding submodule.}

\resumeItem
{First place in ECE368: Data Structures \& Algorithms ``big data challenge"}
{Oct 2017}
{Designed and optimized a Huffman encoding algorithm of an arbitrarily-large input using a multi-threaded approach. Applied principals of data structures and algorithms to heavily optimize C code. Placed first of 83 students for fastest compression of 64GB of data.}


\section*{Work Experience}
