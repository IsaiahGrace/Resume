## Work Experience

### Embedded Systems Engineer: Sestra Systems: Mar 2022 to present
Responsible for the design and implementation of IoT embedded systems. Integrated open source device drivers utilizing C and modern C++. Created new hardware interfacing capabilities on existing bare-metal microcontroller boards. Developed and implemented new device software features. Managed and maintained codebases of key software packages.

### Jr. Embedded Systems Engineer: Sestra Systems: May 2021 to Mar 2022
Responsible for the maintence and enhancement of embedded systems. Leveraged AWS IoT platforms to ensure cloud-device coherence in unreliable network environments.

### Student Researcher: Purdue SoCET team, physical design group: Apr to Aug 2019
Developed layout, place and route, and floorplanning workflows using Cadence software for the SoCET system on a chip physical design.

### Grader: ECE369 Discrete Mathematics: Jan to May 2019
Graded Discrete Mathematics course assignments covering theory of computation, formal logic, graph theory, mathematical induction, state machines, and regular expressions.

### Raft Guide: Outdoor Adventure Rafting, Ocoee River, TN: May to Aug 2018
Guided on class IV-V whitewater. Responsible for customer satisfaction and safety in demanding and dynamic workplace environment. Certified wilderness first responder.

### Operator: Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory: Jan 2016 to May 2018
Collected and verified data from Purdue's linear particle accelerator. Operated the accelerator during overnight shifts, participated in maintenance, and responded to emergency shutdowns.


## Research and Project Experience

### Senior design team: Polymorphic logic: Aug to Dec 2019
Investigated the design and integration of experimental ambipolar transistors using CMOS as a proxy. Personally specified, documented, and implemented the digital control modules for custom logic cells. Integrated the team project into the larger SoCET system on a chip for fabrication at MIT Lincoln Labs.

### MIPS dual-core processor: Sep to Dec 2019
Designed, implemented, tested, and synthesized a MIPS-based processor featuring a five stage pipeline, and two cores with independent coherent L1 caches. Used SystemVerilog to implement RTL logic and testbench scripts for design validation. Synthesized design to target an Altera Cyclone FPGA.

### Tetris hand-held console: Mar to May 2019
Developed an STM32-based handheld Tetris console as a member of a four-person team. Personally created an SPI driver for the embedded display using C++ and assembly.

### ASIC module for USB to AHB bridge: Nov 2018
Collaborated to design and test a USB to AHB bridge suitable for use on an SoC. Personally designed and wrote SystemVerilog code for the USB receiving/decoding submodule.

### First place in ECE368: Data Structures & Algorithms "big data challenge": Oct 2017
Designed and optimized a Huffman encoding algorithm of an arbitrarily-large input using a multi-threaded approach. Applied principals of data structures and algorithms to heavily optimize C code. Placed first of 83 students for fastest compression of 64GB of data.


## Leadership

### Whitewater Kayaking and Caving Consultant: Purdue Outing Club: May 2016 to Dec 2019
Taught caving and whitewater kayaking skills from beginner through advanced levels. Organized and led expeditions. Ensured safe environment for all participants and practiced inclusive leadership within groups.

### Facilitator, participant: EMV sophomore leadership retreat: Sep 2016, 2017, 2018
