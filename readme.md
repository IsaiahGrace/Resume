        ##Research and Project Experience
        
    ###SOCET Research Team, Senior design project: Apr to Dec 2019
Coordinated the work of two teammates in creating a custom layout for two logic cells. Specified, documented, and implemented the digital logic design for an APB bus peripheral device. Integrated the team project into the larger System on a Chip for fabrication at MIT Lincoln Labs.


    ###Tetris hand-held console: Mar to May 2019
Planned and organized a team of four in developing an STM32 based handheld Tetris console. Created an SPI driver for the embedded display using embedded C++ and assembly.


    ###ASIC Module design for USB to AHB bridge: Nov 2018
Collaborated to design and test a USB interface module suitable for use on an SoC. Personally designed and wrote SystemVerilog code for the USB receiving/decoding submodule.


    ###Zork Text Adventure: Oct 2018
Partnered with another student to create a C++ version of the 1977 Zork text adventure game. Utilized Object Oriented Programming and git version control.


    ###1st place in Data Structures -- Big Data Challenge: Oct 2017
Designed and optimized a Huffman encoding algorithm of an arbitrarily large input using a multi-threaded approach. Applied principals of data structures and algorithms to heavily optimize C code. Placed first of 83 students in fasted compression of 64GB of data.


        ##Work Experience
        
    ###Student Researcher: Purdue SoCET team, physical design group: Jun to Aug 2019
Developed layout, place and route, and floorplanning workflows using Cadence software for the SoCET System on a Chip physical design

        
    ###Grader: ECE369 Discrete Mathematics: Jan to May 2019
Graded Discrete Mathematics course assignments covering theory of computation, formal logic, graph theory, mathematical induction, state machines, and regular expressions.


    ###Raft Guide: Outdoor Adventure Rafting: May to Aug 2018
Guided on class IV-V whitewater. Responsible for customer satisfaction and safety in demanding and dynamic workplace environment. Certified Wilderness First Responder.


    ###Operator: Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory: Jan 2016 to May 2018
Collected and verified data from Purdue's linear particle accelerator. Operated the accelerator during overnight shifts and responded to emergency shutdowns due to sparking in the accelerator chamber.


        ##Leadership
        
    ###Whitewater Kayaking and Caving Consultant: Purdue Outing Club: May 2016 to Dec 2019
Lead and organized caving and whitewater kayaking trips. Ensured safe environment for all participants and practiced inclusive leadership within groups.


    ###Facilitator, participant: EMV sophomore leadership retreat: Sep 2016, 2017, 2018
Participated in, and twice facilitated, a leadership retreat exploring inclusive leadership in the classroom and workplace.

    ###Eagle Scout: BSA: 2014
